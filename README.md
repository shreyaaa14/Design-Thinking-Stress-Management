## 🧠 About the Project
This project explores how the **Design Thinking** process can be applied to manage stress effectively.  
By following the five key stages — *Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype,* and *Test* — it shows how structured reflection and creative problem-solving can help students handle academic pressure in a healthy way.

The video includes:
- Understanding the stress cycle  
- Real-life examples (exam stress)  
- Demonstration of relaxation techniques  
- A practical approach to emotional awareness
